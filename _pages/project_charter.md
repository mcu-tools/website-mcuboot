        transparency, including publication of non-confidential minutes
        within a reasonable time following their approval.

5)  Quorum and Voting

    1.  Quorum for Board meetings requires two-thirds of the voting
        representatives of the Governing Board present either in-person or
        via electronic means. The Board may continue to meet if quorum is
        not met, but will not make any binding decisions at the meeting.

    2.  It is the goal of the project to operate as a consensus-based
        community. If any decision requires a vote to move forward, the
        representatives of the Governing Board or any other committees
        established within the Project will vote on a one vote per
        representative basis.

    3.  Except as provided in section 10(a), decisions by vote will be based
        on a majority vote of the voting representatives present either
        in-person or via electronic means.

        applicable, may conduct any vote using an appropriate electronic
        voting mechanism, including the collection of votes via email. In
        the case of an electronic vote where the topic has not been
        previously discussed in a meeting, if any two voting representatives
        object to the electronic vote, the topic will be put onto the agenda
        at the next meeting at which point the decision may then be put up
        for a vote.

6) Antitrust Guidelines

        Compliance Policy available at:

    2.  All Project members will encourage open participation from any
        organization able to meet the membership requirements, regardless of
        competitive interests. The Board will not seek to exclude members
        based on any criteria, requirements or reasons other than those used
        for all members.

7) Budget

    1.  The Governing Board will approve an annual budget and never commit
        to spend in excess of funds raised.

        the Project. In the event that any unbudgeted or otherwise unfunded
        obligation arises related to the Project, Linaro will liaise with

        mitigating actions.

        Expenses will be charged at cost to Linaro, i.e. Linaro will not
        mark up the costs it incurs on the Project. Linaro will not contract
        third-parties, on behalf of the project, without prior approval by
        the Board.

    3.  Under no circumstances will Linaro be expected or be required to
        undertake any action on behalf of the Project that would compromise
